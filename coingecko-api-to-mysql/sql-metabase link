# 📊 Cryptocurrency Insights Dashboard

This project provides an **interactive dashboard** for analyzing and visualizing cryptocurrency market data. Built with **Metabase**, it pulls data from the **CoinGecko API** and is stored in a **MySQL** database for detailed insights into the global cryptocurrency market. The dashboard is designed for easy exploration of key metrics like market capitalization, trading volume, price changes, and more.

## 🚀 **Key Features**

* **KPI Cards** displaying:

  * **Total Market Capitalization**
  * **Average 24h Price Change**
  * **Total Trading Volume (24h)**
  * **Most Recently Updated**

* **Market Insights**:

  * **Top Gainers and Losers** by 24h price change
  * **Market Share by Trading Volume** (Pie Chart)
  * **Price vs Volume Distribution** (Scatter or Bar Chart)
  * **Top 10 Cryptos by Market Cap**

* **Dynamic Filters**:

  * Dropdowns for `coin name`, `symbol`, and `price range`
  * Custom filters for real-time analysis across different coins

## 🔄 **Data Flow and Pipeline**

1. **Data Fetching**:

   * The Python script fetches market data from CoinGecko using the `/coins/markets` endpoint.
   * Parameters: `vs_currency='usd'`, `order='market_cap_desc'`, `per_page=50`
2. **Database Insertion**:

   * Data is inserted into a **MySQL** database table (`crypto`), including fields like:

     * `name`, `symbol`, `price`, `market_cap`, `volume`, `price_change_percentage_24h`, `last_updated`
3. **Visualization**:

   * Metabase connects to the MySQL database and visualizes this data, providing insights into:

     * Market cap distribution
     * Price volatility
     * Trading activity
4. **Dashboard**:

   * Metabase renders a rich, **interactive dashboard** featuring pie charts, bar charts, tables, and KPI cards to visualize the most relevant crypto market metrics.

---

## 💻 **How to Run Locally**

1. Clone the repository and set up your Python environment.
2. Run the Python script to populate your MySQL database with data from CoinGecko.
3. Connect **Metabase** to your **MySQL database**.
4. Import and visualize the data in Metabase using the dashboard link above.

For local development:

* Run MySQL server on port `3306`.
* Ensure Metabase is connected to your MySQL instance.
* Use the public dashboard link for immediate access.

## 🛠 **Challenges Encountered**

During the development of this project, several technical challenges were encountered:

* **MySQL Authentication Issues**: Initial issues with connecting Metabase to MySQL due to `RSA public key` errors. This was resolved by switching to **mysql\_native\_password**.
* **Configuration Issues**: MySQL configuration was adjusted by modifying the `my.ini` file for better performance, including enabling SSL connections.
* **Permissions Issues**: Access was restricted due to lack of proper privileges for the MySQL user (`victor_user`). Permissions were updated to allow connection and data insertion.

---

## 🏆 **Breakthrough Moments**

After overcoming the challenges, the following breakthroughs were achieved:

* **Successful Database Connection**: Successfully configured and connected Metabase to MySQL over SSL, resolving key authentication issues.
* **Data Visualization**: Built a fully interactive dashboard in Metabase to visualize **market cap**, **trading volume**, **price changes**, and other crypto metrics.
* **Real-time Insights**: Enabled real-time tracking of crypto market performance with the latest data pulled from CoinGecko every time the dashboard is accessed.

## 🏁 **Next Steps**

1. **Interactive Filters**: Add search, dropdown filters, and buttons for a more dynamic user experience.
2. **Trendline Visualization**: Implement time-based charts to track historical performance of crypto coins.
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Integrate machine learning models to predict future trends based on historical data.
